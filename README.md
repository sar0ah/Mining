# Data Mining
in our project we chose the dataset of the restaurants in Zomato which is an Indian multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company. This dataset contains information about various restaurants listed on the platform, including their location, cuisine type, ratings, and other essential attributes. Our goal is to analyze the dataset and help visualize the ratings of new restaurants on the platform.
